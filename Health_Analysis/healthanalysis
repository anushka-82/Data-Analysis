I analyzed complex health data using MySQL Workbench, performing detailed queries to extract and manipulate datasets for deeper insights. Leveraging Power BI, I created an interactive and visually compelling dashboard to track key health metrics such as patient outcomes, hospital efficiency, and disease prevalence. The dashboard included dynamic charts, graphs, and drill-downs, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and identify trends in real-time.
